# David Hart's Programming Portfolio
A public repository showing my best work in computer science.

## Acoustics Research

This is some of the code I used when I worked with Dr. Tracianne Neilsen and Dr. Kent Gee 
on jet noise research. My part of the project was to build a computational model that simulated
the jet noise and optimized to match our sound measurements around the jet. I used Matlab to
build the simulation and process the data. For more information, see my published [JASA article](http://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4806567).

For proprietary reasons, the data set is not included.

## CS355 Java Program

This code is just an example of a larger project that I made in one of my classes.
It is a graphics and image processing program that allows the user to draw and manipulate shapes
on the screen, load .obj files for perspective viewing, and perform effects on loaded images.
It is an example of my coding abilities in Java. I am also very familiar with C++.

## CS355 Python Curriculum

After taking CS355, I began working with Dr. Brian Morse doing image processing research. I approached
him about the idea of switching the CS355 class to Python since Python is better suited for image
processing and matrix operations. He agreed to the idea and I rewrote the course labs in Python form.
This is the currently used curriculum for the CS355 course. I also provided the Latex files that
we used to setup the lab specs.

## Lightfield Research

As stated above, I am working with Dr. Morse on image processing research. Specifically, I am currently
working on advanced depth aware effects on lightfield images. We are doing this by using deep learning programs like TensorFlow.
 This is my current research, so I can't share everything, but anything I have
approval to share I will put in this folder.

## Other Interesting Code

This last folder is just a place for other fun and interesting projects I have done. Most weren't for a class,
just out of my own curiosity.

## Raytracer and Pathtracer

This is my project code for my advanced graphics class (CS655). It started out as a raytracer and grew into a path tracer.
Since it is project code, it is a little messy, but it represents many hours of work that I am proud of.
I also included example output images for convenience.
